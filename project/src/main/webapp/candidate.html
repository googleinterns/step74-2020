            <p>Washington (CNN) - Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has
                become a national progressive icon in her first-term in office, will defend
                her congressional seat in a New York Democratic primary election on Tuesday
                .</p>
            <p>Former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has
                emerged as the most high-profile challenger to the congresswoman in a race
                that has featured substantial fundraising and tense clashes between the
                candidates.</p>
            <p>New York's 14th congressional district, which includes parts of the Bronx
                and Queens, is heavily Democratic and considered to be a reliably blue
                seat. It was formerly held for years by veteran Democrat Joe Crowley,
